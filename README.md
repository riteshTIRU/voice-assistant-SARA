# virtual-assistant-SARA-
A software program that can easily operate by your voice
------READ ME------
so before you execute any program:
1. Create a database (in my case name of database: record)
2. Create a table (in my case, table name: rem )
	   attribute 		datatype
	1. Date_Time		datetime
	2. info			varchar(100)	

Recommendation: I would recommend you keep the name of all attributes, databases, and tables the same as me other wise you will face difficulty finding and changing the name in my code.									
		

ONLINE 32 IN speak.py is the statement to use for connecting our code to the database.

my vOICE assistant's name is "SARA".
execute "hotward_detection.py".
after that say "SARA" and then our VOICE assistant will be activated.
